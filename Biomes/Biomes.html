        </div>
        
        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>Forest (starting land)</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                The Forest is the natural Spawn point for the player. The Forest features a medium density of trees and a lot of dirt, and stone. Most materials in the forest help benefit the Start of the Game.
                The Wood can be used to help make a work bench and later craft a furnace which is why the forest is good at the start, also the forest has many chests that can feature loot like enchanted boomerangs and Finch staffs. 
                Another neat thing about the forest is that you can find a <u>Sub Biome</u> called the tree of life which usually has some chests in it!
                The background of this website is also what the forest looks like too.
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>The Dessert</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
             A mostly forgetable biome that features everything a dessert would, such as vultures sand and a lot of cacti. The biome itself is weak, but the underground dessert carries it.
             The underground dessert biome has chests filled with good loot to start with like whips for summoners. Another thing about the dessert is that it has an <u>Event</u> called a sandstorm.
             The sandstorm pushes the player in the direction of the flying sand. The most important part of the sandstorm is in hardmode. During hardmode, a sand elemental can spawn which drops Forbidden Fragments which can be used to craft magic weapons and armor.
             The Dessert has one Sub Biome which is called the Oasis. Its just a pond with trees, nothing special.
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>World Evils</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                The World Evils are tough biomes to deal with, as they hold stronger than normal enemies and the biome spreads! The two evils are Corruption and Crimson, both are VERY different.
                When Hardmode starts, the evil biome expands by a lot and usually infects 
                
                <br><br><u>Crimson</u> - Has things like face monsters and a lot of bloody stuff.. But thankfully it is the easier to traverse. The Crimson has the boss Brain of Cluthlu when breaking three Crimson hearts
                In hardmode, certain enemies get Ichor which is a projectile that inflicts Ichor debuff which lowers your defence Substantially.

                <br><br><u>Corruption</u> - A LOT of flying mobs spawn here Corrupters that chase you mid-air and more corrupters. This is the harder biome to travel across because the biome presents with giant chasms between each jump.
                The boss for this biome is the Eater of Worlds which is a giant worm. In hardmode, the corrupted flame debuff becomes potent, and is just a stronger "On fire!" debuff.
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>The Jungle</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                The Jungle is like the forest on steroids, hard early game still hard late game. The jungle is full of fierce bees and Man Catchers and the Queen bee and bee hive sub biome.
                In hardmode the jungle really becomes important as after beating the Three Mecahnical bosses (Destroyer, Twins, Skeletron Prime.) the Plantera boss can be summoned which is a giant flower creature thing. 
                Plantera is literally the bane of every terraria players existance, it is a ultra hard boss to fight (also has some rock music when fighting it to reference the band Pantera.).
                After the boss Plantera is defeated you can access the second Sub-Biome of the Jungle, the Lizarhd temple (AKA the Jungle temple). The jungle temple is riddled with traps that deal way too much damage. 
                The Temple holds the Boss golem also, which is so much easier than plantera and is zero threat. 
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>The Dungeon</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                The dungeon is a fort on either side of the map (Jungle on one side, dungeon on the Other eg, Dungeon left, jungle right). When you first see the dungeon you will see an NPC called the Old Man, which when talked to during the night time gives you a special option. 
                The option is called "Curse" and when you click that option, The old man literally explodes and summons Skeletron. The fight of Skeletron is realtively hard but it is easy with preperation. 
                If you are to kill skeletron, you gain access to the dungeons underground section (if you try to go early you get one shot by the <u>Dungeon Guardian.</u>).
                The dungeon has many locked chests like the Biome Chests (descibed later) and golden locked chests which have very powerful weapons like the murasama.
                <br><br>Another neat fact about the dungeon is even though its already packed full of tough enemies and traps is that after you beat plantera you will get a special text saying this: "Screams are echoing from the dungeon... "
                as this suggests the dungeon becomes 20 times harder and gets 300x better drops, and allows access to the Biome chests.
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>The Ocean</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                The ocean is bar far the lamest biome in all of terraria. It has one sub biome (although it is the newest and coolest biome in terraria). The ocean is at the END of both sides of a world, therefore there are two ocean biomes always
                The ocean has one NPC that is the Angler. He is a kid that gives you fishing quests and is found Floating asleep on the ocean (he spawns on either ocean randomly.).
                <br><br>Near the ocean if you mine down you will find the Aether sub biome which when entered changes the background to a space setting with mystical music. The biome has a notable pond with a pink liquid (almost like the oasis underground.).
                The liquid is called Shimmer and when you certain items into the liquid they will transform into better items, also jumping in the water will make you fall until there is an empty gap for you to retouch the ground.
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>The Hallowed</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                The hallowed biome is a hardmode exclusive biome that spawns when you beat the Wall of Flesh. The Hallowed biome resembles a stereotypical fantasy setting with unicorns and pixies everywhere.
                With that said the Hallowed biome is pretty hard to deal with. The biome is considered the opposite of the world evil and is considered pure in the Dryads eyes.
                As most players know the hallowed biome is not pure. <br><br> There are two main bosses in the hallowed biome and one sub biome. The first main boss is the <u>Queen Slime</u> (not to be confused with the King slime)
                And the <u>Empress of Light</u>. The Queen Slime is important because you need to access the Sub Biome the Underground Hallow to get the boss Summon. The Empress of light is summoned by killing a certain butterfly that spawns in the hallow during the night.
                If the empress is killed during the day (During the day all her attacks also one shot no matter what making her have the highest dps in the game) you will get the strongest Summoner weapon in the whole game, The Terraprism.
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>Underground Biomes</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                There are two main points to this. The standard underground and biome specific underground biomes.
                <br><br> biome specific Underground areas are usually exactly like the the standard biome but with one or two extra mobs or minerals. 
                <br><br> The standard underground biomes are a bit more deep the biggest underground biome being Hell. We will start of with the majority of the underground.
                The majority is usually like a standard mine, with chests and other fun stuff. The REAL fun stuff is when it comes to hell. Hell is the length of the whole world and is full of lava devils and shadow chest.
                Shadow chests contain useful buffs but the biggest buff you can get is from the hellstone bars you get from hell which make some of the best armor and equipment pre-hardmode.

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>Other small Biomes</u></h1>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square; font-size:1.5vw">
             <li> floating islands - located in space, they always have one chest that ALWAYS has an item in it
             <li> Spider Biome - Filled with deadly spiders, contains the Hair stylist Npc and in hardmode enemies drop materials to make summoner armor
             <li> Jungle temple - As mentioned before, has the golem and a bunch of traps. Also contains summons for the Solar Eclipse event
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #d47800c5; color: black;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>What are Biome Keys and Chests?</u></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                biome Keys are used to open the biome chests. To get a biome chest you have to kill any mob in the biome correlating to the biome key you want. To even get keys, Platera must be defeated in the World.
                Each biome chest contains the same weapon in any world. All of these weapons are really over powered. 
                <br><br>NOTE: if your world is missing a certain biome, it will NOT have that chest and all Biome chests are located in the Dungeon
            </h1>
            
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw;"><u>All Biome chest's contents</u></h1>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square; font-size:1.5vw">
                <li> Jungle Chest - Pirahna Gun, shoots a pirahna that sticks to enemies and does mediocore damage
                <li> Hallowed Chest - Rainbow gun, shoots a rainbow that does tick damage to anything that touches it, really good to just shoot out and switch weapons.
                <li> Ice Chest - Staff of the Frost Hydra, summons a frozen beast turret that stays in one place and shoots freezing shots at nearby enemies, pretty good for summoners
                <li> Crimson Chest - Vampire Knives, a reusable set of knives that on hit heal the user, really ok damage, use when low to heal to full during a boss fight
                <li> Corrupted Chest - Scourage of the Corrupter, another reusable projectile that shoots out a projectile that on contact with the ground or an opponent, split off into more projectiles that bounce of walls.
                <li> Dessert Chest - Dessert Tiger staff, Summons a tiger that increases with power the more <u>summon slots it holds</u>
